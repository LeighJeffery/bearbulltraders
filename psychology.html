                  Dr. Kenneth Reid is a seasoned trader and trading coach with a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. He was the Senior Editor and Head

                  Since then he has focused full-time on coaching daytraders of all levels of skill, 
                  experience and account size. He treats newbies with the same

                  sport and applies the principles of modern sports psychology to trading.
                   Dr Reid was a qualifier at the USTA Nationals in 2018. He’s still working on his serve.

            Michael retired with the rank of Sergeant Major after 23 years of service in the United States Marine Corps. During his time in the service, he taught Marines on subjects such as strategic leadership, mentorship, and discipline. In February of 2018, while visiting Marines in the work center, Michael stumbled upon Andrew’s book, How to Day Trade for a Living. Upon finishing the book, he realized that it would require time, substantial training, and literally a ton of self-evaluation in order to become a consistently profitable trader. He then joined Bear Bull Traders as a lifetime member, attended the educational classes, developed a business plan, and started reading psychology books, all for the purpose of pursuing in the best fashion possible his desire to become a full-time trader upon retirement from the service.</p>
            <p>

              Michael has been happily married for 20 years and has 2 wonderful children. Outside of trading, he enjoys spending time with his family, volunteering as a soccer referee, and playing sports.
