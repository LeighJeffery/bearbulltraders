                <p>We happily offer a 7-day money-back guarantee (7 calendar days) on our membership plans with no questions asked. This refund policy applies to first-time users who sign up for our services. 
                   <Strong>You can request a refund within 7 calendar days of signing up for a new membership subscription. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods.
                     We do not provide refunds or credits for unused membership or unused content. </Strong> 
                </p>
        
                <p>However, please note that multiple refunds will not be offered if the member signs up more than once or requests a refund due to a membership upgrade. We strictly enforce a limit of 1 refund per person.</p>
        
                <p>The only fee that is not refundable is the simulator cost. However, you can still use your simulator until its expiry date (3 months after the starting date), even though you canceled with us and are no longer part of our community. It is yours; you paid for it!
                </p>

                  Additionally, please be aware that refund transactions may incur a fee of around 3.2% on the total refunded amount depending on your credit card or financial institution.  We will fully refund the amount you paid, but the processing fees may not come back to your account. In this case, you need to contact your financial institution to recover your fees.

                <h3 class="mt-5">Lifetime Memberships</h3>
                <p class="text-decoration-underline">Please note: we no longer offer lifetime memberships. The below is simply for reference for current lifetime members.</p>
                <p>
                    Many traders interested in our lifetime membership plan may wonder how this plans works. Essentially: What does “lifetime” mean? Whose life? What if I join as a lifetime member today and in 2 years the community is no longer around? What happens to my membership?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We agree that these are very fair and important questions, and we have therefore defined a refund policy for our lifetime memberships should the day come that Bear Bull Traders closes down. If for any reason Bear Bull Traders does not stand anymore, we will refund lifetime members based on the date they joined the community. We will deduct the number of months (or partial months) that they have been a member, based on the monthly fee at the time of their registration, and then refund the balance. An additional deduction will also be made if the member had purchased 3 months of access to the simulator.
