            <h1 class="mb-4 fw-bold">Refund Policy</h1>
            <p>We happily offer a 7-day money-back guarantee (7 calendar days) on our membership plans with no questions asked. This refund policy applies to first-time users who sign up for our services. However, please note that multiple refunds will not be offered if the member signs up more than once or requests a refund due to a membership upgrade. We strictly enforce a limit of 1 refund per person.</p>
    
            <p>The only fee that is not refundable is the simulator cost. However, you can still use your simulator until its expiry date (3 months after the starting date), even though you canceled with us and are no longer part of our community. It is yours; you paid for it!</p>
    
            <p>Additionally, please be aware that refund transactions may incur a fee of around 3.2% on the total refunded amount depending on your credit card or financial institution. We will fully refund the amount you paid, but the processing fees may not come back to your account. In this case, you need to contact your financial institution to recover your fees. If you are not certain that our community is right for you, please take out our 7-day trial (7 calendar days) to get a feel for the community. You can always upgrade to other plans after signing up. Just let us know, and we will be sure to provide the necessary information.</p>
    
            <h2 class="mt-4">Lifetime Memberships</h2>
            <p>Please note: we no longer offer lifetime memberships. The below is simply for reference for current lifetime members.</p>
    
            <p>Many traders interested in our lifetime membership plan may wonder how this plan works. Essentially: What does “lifetime” mean? Whose life? What if I join as a lifetime member today and in 2 years the community is no longer around? What happens to my membership?</p>
    
            <p>We agree that these are very fair and important questions, and we have therefore defined a refund policy for our lifetime memberships should the day come that Bear Bull Traders closes down. If for any reason Bear Bull Traders does not stand anymore, we will refund lifetime members based on the date they joined the community. We will deduct the number of months (or partial months) that they have been a member, based on the monthly fee at the time of their registration, and then refund the balance. An additional deduction will also be made if the member had purchased 3 months of access to the simulator.</p>
    
            <h3 class="mt-3">Example A:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader A joins Bear Bull Traders in January 2020 as a Lifetime Member at $1,499.</li>
                <li>Bear Bull Traders shuts down in April 2020. In this case:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trader A’s plan provided 3 months of access to the simulator: $450 value.</li>
                    <li>Trader A has been a member for only 4 months: January 2020 to April 2020.</li>
                    <li>Monthly membership fee at the time of their subscription was $99.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>We will refund Trader A their payment after deduction of $450 and 4x$99: $1499-$450-(4x$99)=$653.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3 class="mt-3">Example B:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader B joins Bear Bull Traders in January 2020 as a Lifetime Member at $1199.</li>
                <li>Bear Bull Traders shuts down in September 2020. In this case:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trader B’s plan did not provide 3 months of access to the simulator.</li>
                    <li>Trader B has been a member for only 9 months: January 2020 to September 2020.</li>
                    <li>Monthly membership fee at the time of their subscription was $99.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>We will refund Trader B their payment after deduction of 9x$99: $1199-(9x$99)=$308.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3 class="mt-3">Example C:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader C joins Bear Bull Traders in January 2020 as a Lifetime Member at $1,499.</li>
                <li>Bear Bull Traders shuts down in September 2021. In this case:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trader C’s plan provided 3 months of access to the simulator: $450 value.</li>
                    <li>Trader C has been a member for 21 months: January 2020 to September 2021.</li>
                    <li>Monthly membership fee at the time of their subscription was $99.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Total value of services used by Trader C: $450 + (21x$99) = $2529. There will be no refund for Trader C as $2,529 is more than what Trader C paid when they purchased their lifetime membership plan.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>We of course hope that Bear Bull Traders will stand for a very long time, but as nothing is forever, we introduced this policy as a way to support our lifetime members.</p>
