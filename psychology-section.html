              John retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States
              Army after 21 years of service. Five years of his career
              were spent as an instructor at the United States Military
              Academy, which is where he developed a passion for educating
              others. While in the Army, he also became fascinated with
              day trading and began to consume any information he could
              find on the topic. However, on his own he was unable to turn
              that knowledge into consistent trading profits.
            </p>

            <p>
              The turning points in his trading career were reading
              Andrewâ€™s book, How to Day Trade for a Living, and then
              joining the Bear Bull Traders community upon his military
              retirement. With the education provided by the BBT
              moderators, months of simulated trading, and months of small
              risk trading, John was able to find consistent profitability
              within his first year.
            </p>

            <p>
              John has been married for 20 years and is the father of 2
              teenage boys. In his spare time he enjoys playing mediocre
              guitar, mountain biking, and watching his sons play hockey.
