                    John retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States
                    Army after 21 years of service. Five years of his career
                    were spent as an instructor at the United States Military
                    Academy, which is where he developed a passion for educating
                    others. While in the Army, he also became fascinated with
                    day trading and began to consume any information he could
                    find on the topic. However, on his own he was unable to turn
                    that knowledge into consistent trading profits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The turning points in his trading career were reading
                    Andrewâ€™s book, How to Day Trade for a Living, and then
                    joining the Bear Bull Traders community upon his military
                    retirement. With the education provided by the BBT
                    moderators, months of simulated trading, and months of small
                    risk trading, John was able to find consistent profitability
                    within his first year.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    John has been married for 20 years and is the father of 2
                    teenage boys. In his spare time he enjoys playing mediocre
                    guitar, mountain biking, and watching his sons play hockey.
