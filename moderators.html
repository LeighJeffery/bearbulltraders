                    For almost as long as Brian can remember, he has been
                    interested in stocks and the market. When he was a preteen,
                    he would watch his father pour over the stock listings in
                    the newspaper and occasionally hear him on the phone with
                    his broker, placing orders to buy and sell shares. One day,
                    Brian asked his father if he could buy some stock and his
                    father said, “Sure.” Brian opened an account and bought 1
                    (one), yes, 1 share of “The Bell Telephone Company of
                    Canada”. He still has that 1 share today and it has
                    multiplied into a couple of dozen shares through splits and
                    a dividend reinvestment program. That was the starting point
                    for his stock ownership/trading career. Ever since, Brian
                    has been interested in stocks and the stock market and has
                    traded throughout most of his adult life, managing his own
                    investment portfolio. Brian has 2 degrees, including an MBA,
                    and he also took the Canadian Securities Course.

                    The advent of the Internet and online trading changed the
                    financial industry dramatically. While holding down a
                    regular 9-to-5 corporate job, Brian tried his hand at day
                    trading during the dotcom era. He made a lot of money and
                    then lost a lot of money. It was a humbling lesson but he
                    learned much and thankfully did not suffer the fate of many
                    who lost more than they started with.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Brian retired from the corporate world in 2014 after over 30
                    years of service. Andrew and he had met and worked together
                    for a number of years in another field. Today, they continue
                    to work together doing what they both enjoy: trading and
                    helping others achieve their goals.

                    Carlos Moreta is a full-time day trader and respected
                    moderator at Bear Bull Traders. His introduction to the
                    field of day trading came via Andrew Aziz’ influential book,
                    How to Day Trade for a Living. After reading but a few
                    chapters, Carlos was intrigued by the possibilities day
                    trading could provide for him and his family. Recognizing
                    the importance of a comprehensive education, Carlos enrolled
                    in Bear Bull Traders’ training courses, dedicating himself
                    to conquering the learning curve inherent in trading. With
                    his extensive knowledge and well-honed skills, he
                    successfully transitioned to live trading in January 2018.

                  <p>
                    Carlos’ professional journey as a day trader was preceded by
                    an impressive 12-year tenure in logistics and customer
                    operations management at a prominent home appliance company.
                    When the company decided to relocate, Carlos seized the
                    opportunity to pursue what had become his true passion.
                    Embracing the challenge, he embarked on a full-time career
                    in day trading, leveraging his wealth of experience and
                    astute business acumen.

                    Dimah’s life changed after reading Andrew’s first book, How
                    to Day Trade for a Living. By the time she reached the last
                    page, Dimah knew without a doubt that trading is what she
                    wanted to do for the rest of her life. And so, after 10
                    years of establishing a career in home building management,
                    she decided to become a day trader. Dimah joined Bear Bull
                    Traders in early 2019. She attended all of the classes
                    offered, read all of the books recommended, and studied hard
                    all year while still working full time. In April 2020, after
                    successfully trading in the simulator, she made the leap to

                    Anya is originally from Belarus. Since her childhood, Anya
                    dreamed of moving to the United States one day. In Belarus,
                    Anya graduated from university with a degree in economics.
                    She tried a number of different professions, but never felt
                    like, “Yes, this is the one.” Then Anya made her first
                    trade. The beginning of her trading journey unfortunately
                    did not unfold in the best possible fashion, but Anya
                    remained dedicated and devoted to pushing forward with her
                    goal of becoming a successful trader. Mission accomplished.
                    Anya has now been trading for one full year. And she lives
                    in Los Angeles!

                  <p>
                    Aside from trading, Anya is a very active person with
                    literally a ton of ideas and creativity. Her most
                    significant value is freedom. She loves sports, regularly
                    working out, and practicing yoga. Anya also has a passion
                    for psychology. In the last few years, she has successfully
                    completed several courses in coaching and psychology. In
                    addition, she has a deep interest in astrology and art
                    psychology. Overall, Anya is a very curious person. If she
                    does not understand something, she is driven to learn about
                    it.

                    John retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States
                    Army after 21 years of service. Five years of his career
                    were spent as an instructor at the United States Military
                    Academy, which is where he developed a passion for educating
                    others. While in the Army, he also became fascinated with
                    day trading and began to consume any information he could
                    find on the topic. However, on his own he was unable to turn
                    that knowledge into consistent trading profits. The turning
                    points in his trading career were reading Andrew’s book, How
                    to Day Trade for a Living, and then joining the Bear Bull
                    Traders community upon his military retirement. With the
                    education provided by the BBT moderators, months of
                    simulated trading, and months of small risk trading, John
                    was able to find consistent profitability within his first
                    year.

                    guitar, mountain biking, and watching his sons play hockey.

                    Tiffany picked up Andrew’s book, How to Day Trade for a

                    for a career as a trader. She knew nothing about the markets
                    before delving into the newly found opportunity. She became
                    a member of Bear Bull Traders immediately. After 6 months of
                    simulator, attending all of the BBT classes, watching
                    countless YouTube videos, and journaling every day, Tiffany
                    finally found her edge 2 years later.

                    Tiffany’s background is in psychology. She started her
                    career as a counselor at a children’s hospital. While she
                    remains passionate about children and mental health, trading
                    gives her the flexibility to still be a full-time mom.

                    design lemonade stand in Silicon Valley. Life events moved
                    him to Las Vegas and further expanded his career into IT
                    administration where he gained valuable experience working
                    for MGM Corporate (now MGM Resorts). Always wanting to
                    expand his knowledge, he left to head the IT department for
                    a construction tech startup founded by City Center veterans.
                    When the recession hit and things slowed down in Las Vegas,
                    he decided to go back to university where he received a
                    BSBA, majoring in Sports Medicine, and Entrepreneurship.

                    While at UNLV studying for his degree, he co-founded an AI
                    startup that focused on drone / AI technology in the
                    construction industry, winning various pitch / startup
                    competitions, and partnering with Lockheed Martin – CDL
                    Systems on the idea. It was shortly after this time that he
                    found Andrew’s “How to Day Trade for a Living” while
                    researching for an AI / algorithmic trading idea. He joined
                    BBT officially in May of 2018 and began full-time day
                    trading in early 2020, bringing his vast technology
                    experience to the community in his attempt to remove as many
                    hurdles to entry for himself and others along the way.

                    After moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to earn
                    his PhD in chemical engineering, Andrew (Amin) spent several
                    years working in various research scientist positions in the
                    cleantech industry. After being let go from one particular
                    position, he decided to focus his energy on the financial
                    industry and trading markets. With drive and determination,
                    Andrew started studying the stock market. Everyone,
                    including himself, was doubtful. How can someone sitting at
                    home, in front of their computer, beat Wall Street at its
                    own game? Andrew persevered though. He did not listen to his
                    own fears and the doubts of others.

                    In 2015, he published his first book, How to Day Trade for a

                    trading, written for everyone, regardless of their financial
                    market knowledge. Later, in 2016, he started the Bear Bull
                    Traders community (formerly known as Vancouver-Traders), as
                    a forum for serious traders to share their knowledge and
                    expertise with other traders around the world.

                    Andrew is in a lifelong affair with Nature! Whenever he is

                    climbing. Ask him about breathing at 28,000 feet!

                    Thor Young has over 3 years of professional trading
                    experience and has been a moderator at BBT for over a year.
                    He prides himself in creating high quality educational
                    material to help explain the complexities of the market in
                    common language. Thor got started trading while working for
                    an options trading platform. He started cutting his teeth on
                    the market and became fascinated with the execution side of
                    trading. After working for over a decade in the IT field,
                    his daughter, Allie, was diagnosed with nonverbal autism.
                    That moment changed his family and shifted their life’s
                    priorities considerably. Thor, his beautiful wife Janelle,
                    their son JD, and their daughter relocated so Allie could
                    attend a private Autism school. Thor also made the decision
                    to leave the demanding IT field in order to be able to focus
                    more on his family. During this relocation, Thor came across
                    Andrew’s book. After reading it cover to cover, Thor knew he
                    wanted to become a trader. He joined the room shortly after.
                    Since then, he has studied hard to become a consistently
                    profitable trader and help his trading community whenever
                    possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a family man, Thor’s favorite thing to do is hitting the
                    beach with his wife and kids, and living each day with them
                    to the fullest.

                    Aiman is first and foremost a medical student. He personally
                    knew nothing about the stock market until he found himself
                    becoming interested in the crypto market. It took a few
                    months, but after realizing that the crypto market wasn’t
                    for him, he shifted toward the stock market. He read many
                    books, some better than others, and then one day, Andrew’s
                    book, How to Day Trade for a Living, was recommended to him
                    on Amazon. Andrew’s book was the game changer! Because of
                    it, Aiman joined BBT at the end of May 2018 and has been a
                    member ever since. After 8 months of simulator practice, and
                    after finally finding his edge, he started live trading in
                    January 2019.

                    Michael retired with the rank of Sergeant Major after 23
                    years of service in the United States Marine Corps. During
                    his time in the service, he taught Marines on subjects such
                    as strategic leadership, mentorship, and discipline. In
                    February of 2018, while visiting Marines in the work center,
                    Michael stumbled upon Andrew’s book, How to Day Trade for a
                    Living. Upon finishing the book, he realized that it would
                    require time, substantial training, and literally a ton of
                    self-evaluation in order to become a consistently profitable
                    trader. He then joined Bear Bull Traders as a lifetime
                    member, attended the educational classes, developed a
                    business plan, and started reading psychology books, all for
                    the purpose of pursuing in the best fashion possible his
                    desire to become a full-time trader upon retirement from the

                    Avi was a full time Flight Instructor after graduating from
                    Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. He retired from the
                    cockpit at the age of 25 because the rigid world of
                    professional aviation was detaching him from his romance for
                    flying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2017 he discovered the mind-bending world of contrarian
                    investing and has since been deeply immersed in it. Avi
                    became hooked to the business of Day Trading in September
                    2019 when he read Andrew’s iconic first book. He has since
                    dedicated himself to being a trader as opposed to making a
                    living out of day trading. His 80/20 approach to the process
                    has enabled him to achieve the lifestyle and freedoms that
                    day trading offers. The day trading mentorship role came
                    naturally to Avi from his Flight Instructing days and is
                    something he does wholeheartedly.

                    When not planning investments, day trading or mentoring, Avi
                    spends his time in recreational flying, surfing and various
                    watersports, off-roading, riding motorcycles, cricket,
                    playing guitar, snowboarding, learning golf, weight lifting
                    and being the best dad he can possibly be to his 2 kids.

                    Born and raised in Quebec, Canada, I’ve always had an
                    adventurous spirit and a thirst for knowledge. After
                    completing my studies in Finance and Real Estate, I ventured
                    into the world of trading, where I discovered my true

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With over five years of experience in the financial markets,
                    I’ve had the privilege of trading full-time for the past
                    three years. My journey into trading had started with the
                    guidance of Bear Bull Traders that has played an important
                    role in my growth and success.

                  <p>
                    Beyond the trading world, I find fulfillment in exploring a
                    diverse range of interests. From the adrenaline rush of
                    sports to the serenity of travel and the creative outlet of
                    cooking, each pursuit adds richness to my life.

                    Trading has not only been a profession but also a gateway to
                    living my dream of residing in Colombia. Thanks to the
                    flexibility and autonomy that trading provides, I’ve been
                    able to fully embrace this new chapter of my life.

                    trading skills through day trading, swing trading, and then
                    options trading. He joined Bear Bull Traders, knowing that

                    Hoping to become increasingly proficient in options, Jarad
                    provides traders a fresh perspective on using new strategies

                    Paras is a Software Engineering Manager, managing
                    multi-million dollar projects in the latest niche
                    technologies at one of the Fortune Global Top 100 companies.
                    Originally from India and currently settled in the USA,
                    Paras, from a very early age, was enthusiastic about the
                    financial market and recalls (in 8th grade) sitting in front
                    of a financial news channel and noting all the company’s
                    symbols with their respective quotes in his notebook without
                    having any idea about what they meant.The interest in
                    financial markets never stopped growing and inspired him to
                    explore areas within, that he would be most interested in.
                    The exploration journey of his led him to become a Level 3
                    certified in NSE (National Stock Exchange, India) and even
                    got into Master’s in Financial Engineering program which he
                    later voluntarily dropped out as it did not meet his
                    interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nevertheless, It was in 2015 when Paras moved to the USA, he
                    came across Andrew’s book “How to Day Trade for Living” that
                    made him realize that Day Trading was what he was really
                    interested and passionate about. There was no looking back.
                    Paras then joined Bear Bull Traders (Vancouver-Traders back
                    then) and became one of the initial members of the
                    community. Paras has since expanded his day trading horizon
                    to actively Swing and Options trade as well.
