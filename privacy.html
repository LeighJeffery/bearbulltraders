        <h1 class="mb-4 fw-bold">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Bear Bull Traders. We value your privacy and strive to protect your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you visit our website <a href="https://bearbulltraders.com" target="_blank">https://bearbulltraders.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">What Personal Data We Collect and Why</h2>
        
        <h3 class="mt-3">Media</h3>
        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Contact Forms</h3>
        <p>If you submit a contact form on our website, we collect the data provided in the form to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries. We do not use the information submitted through contact forms for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Cookies</h3>
        <p>We use cookies to enhance your browsing experience. If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address, and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
        <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
        <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
        <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Embedded Content from Other Websites</h3>
        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Analytics</h3>
        <p>We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to track and report on website traffic. These services may collect information about your use of the site and use cookies to provide their reports. You can learn more about Google’s privacy practices <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Who We Share Your Data With</h3>
        <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties except as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">How Long We Retain Your Data</h3>
        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
        <p>For users that register on our website, we store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">What Rights You Have Over Your Data</h3>
        <p>If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Where We Send Your Data</h3>
        <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">What Data Breach Procedures We Have in Place</h3>
        <p>In the event of a data breach, we have procedures in place to quickly and effectively respond, including notifying affected users and relevant authorities as required by law.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">What Third Parties We Receive Data From</h3>
        <p>We may receive data about you from third parties, such as social media platforms, but only if you have given your consent to those third parties to share your information with us.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">What Automated Decision Making and/or Profiling We Do with User Data</h3>
        <p>We do not use automated decision making or profiling that significantly affects you.</p>
